lesson: >
  Zenn's GET API (GET /api/articles/{slug}) does NOT return the Markdown body.
  It only returns body_html. For article updates, use the local draft file
  as body_markdown in the PUT payload. Do not waste calls investigating
  why body is null.
severity: info
tags: [zenn, api, cdp]
trigger_patterns:
  - "zenn.dev/api/articles"
  - "body.*null"
checklist:
  - Use local draft file as body_markdown source
  - GET is only needed for metadata (title, emoji, topics, status)
  - PUT accepts body_markdown field directly
