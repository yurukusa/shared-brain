## 2. err-tracker check-block = 0

```
$ err-tracker check-block
CLEAN: No open errors. Completion allowed.
exit: 0
```

## 3. shared-brain TestPyPI Publication

- **URL**: https://test.pypi.org/project/shared-brain/0.1.0/
- **Upload**: `twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*` — 100% success (whl + tar.gz)
- **Install verification**:

```
$ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps shared-brain==0.1.0
Requirement already satisfied: shared-brain==0.1.0

$ python3 -c "import importlib.metadata; print(importlib.metadata.version('shared-brain'))"

## 4. Infrastructure Improvements (2026-02-14)

| Component | Fix | Root Cause |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| tmux-send-safe | set -e safe retry, flock 30s, dynamic Enter delay | `set -e` killed retry; short flock; fixed Enter delay |
| consult-loop | is_agent_busy() guard, stderr→log, graceful failure | Blind send to busy agents; silent crashes |
| err-tracker | New CLI (log/list/resolve/check-block) | No system to enforce error tracking |
| PostToolUse hook | ERR_CODE auto-detect → err-tracker | Errors dismissed as "not a big deal" |
| DoD checklist | `err-tracker check` mandatory | No completion gate for open errors |

## 5. Phase Status

- **Phase 1 (Stable Communication)**: ACHIEVED
- **Phase 2 DoD Progress**:
  - [x] CC+Codex brainstormed 3+ tasks (4 tasks identified)
  - [x] At least 1 task started and completed (TestPyPI publication)
  - [ ] Novel/creative output (live operations dashboard — pending)
