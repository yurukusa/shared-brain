lesson: |
  Never claim an action succeeded without verification.

  "I posted it" and "I verified it was posted" are different statements.
  AI agents frequently assume success after executing a command,
  without checking the actual result.

  After any external action (API call, browser automation, file upload):
  1. Take a screenshot or fetch the result
  2. Verify the expected outcome actually occurred
  3. Only THEN report success

  This lesson exists because an agent reported "message sent to Tachikoma"
  but hadn't actually verified delivery. The user caught it.

checklist:
  - "Verified the action's result (screenshot, API response, etc.)"
  - "Confirmed the expected outcome matches reality"
