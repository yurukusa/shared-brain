lesson: |
  Force push, hard reset, and recursive delete are destructive
  operations that cannot be easily undone.

  Before any destructive git operation:
  1. Create a backup branch
  2. Verify you're on the correct branch
  3. Confirm the operation with the user

  Force pushing to main/master should NEVER happen without
  explicit user request.

checklist:
  - "Created backup branch (git checkout -b backup/...)"
  - "Verified current branch is correct"
  - "User explicitly requested this destructive operation"
