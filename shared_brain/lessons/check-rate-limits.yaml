lesson: |
  Check API rate limits before making bulk requests.
  Hitting rate limits can lock you out for hours and break your workflow.

  ALWAYS:
  1. Read the API docs for rate limit info
  2. Add delays between requests (at least 1 second)
  3. Handle 429 responses with exponential backoff
  4. Process in small batches, not all at once

checklist:
  - "Rate limit documented for this API"
  - "Delay between requests added"
  - "429 handler implemented"
