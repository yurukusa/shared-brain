lesson: |
  Read the full error message before trying to fix the problem.
  Most error messages tell you exactly what went wrong and where.

  ALWAYS:
  1. Read the ENTIRE error message, not just the first line
  2. Check the stack trace for the actual source of the error
  3. Search for the specific error text if unclear
  4. Fix the root cause, not the symptom

checklist:
  - "Full error message read"
  - "Root cause identified"
  - "Fix addresses root cause, not symptom"
