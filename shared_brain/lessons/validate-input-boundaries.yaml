lesson: |
  Always validate and sanitize external input at system boundaries.
  User input, API responses, and file contents can contain
  unexpected data that causes security vulnerabilities or crashes.

  ALWAYS:
  1. Validate type, length, and format
  2. Sanitize for the target context (SQL, HTML, shell)
  3. Reject invalid input early with clear error messages
  4. Never trust data from external sources

checklist:
  - "Input type validated"
  - "Input length bounded"
  - "Sanitized for target context"
